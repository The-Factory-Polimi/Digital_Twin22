ManPy package installed using the following command does not have any simulation related files inside the library.

```python
python3 -m pipenv install manpy
```

It was first noticed while trying to run the following code:

```python
import manpy
# Create the simulation
sim = manpy.Simulation()

# Set the simulation parameters
sim.max_time = 1000
sim.seed = 123

# Create the machines
machine1 = manpy.Machine("Machine 1")
machine2 = manpy.Machine("Machine 2")

# Create the buffers
buffer1 = manpy.Buffer("Buffer 1", capacity=10)
buffer2 = manpy.Buffer("Buffer 2", capacity=10)

# Create the sources and sinks
source = manpy.Source("Source", output_flow=buffer1)
sink = manpy.Sink("Sink", input_flow=buffer2)

# Connect the elements of the model
machine1.input_flow = buffer1
machine1.output_flow = buffer2
machine2.input_flow = buffer2
machine2.output_flow = sink

# Run the simulation
sim.start_all()

# Analyze the results
print(f"Total number of entities: {sink.number_of_entities}")
print(f"Utilization of Machine 1: {machine1.utilization:.2f}")
print(f"Utilization of Machine 2: {machine2.utilization:.2f}")
```

It was then confirmed by checking the library contents directly at the site of library installation.


Hence, retired to install ManPy available from ManPy's github repository: https://github.com/nexedi/dream. The docuementation for ManPy which had the installation guidelines are available at https://github.com/Nexedi/dream/raw/master/ManPy_documentation.pdf.
As per the guidelines in the abaove documentation, running setup.py file inside the package should have installed ManPy and related packages. The installation was tried with different perspectives including trying to install outside the virtual environment. But it gave out following error:

```
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement setup.py (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for setup.py
```

One of the probable solution was to install the required dependencies manually before executing the setup.py file. The requirements were obtained from the list of requirements inside the setup.py script. Still the above mentioned error was repeated. Following were the requiremnts mentioned:
- flask
- SimPy>=3
- xlrd
- xlwt
- pyparsing
- pydot
- numpy
- zope.dottedname
- rpy2
- pulp
- tablib
- mysqlclient

It has to be noted that, ManPy documentation has described the fact that, ManPy is a project under the name DREAM.

It has come to attention that, the codes inside DREAM is developed using Python2 and has compatibility issues with Python3 (example: print()). Also, some modules available in DT_ManPy codes are not present in the DREAM (example: ProcessingTimeList inside the simulation folder).

An example given in the aforementioned documentation of DREAM was used to test the libraries. Example used is 4.1 from docuemntation for single server system. The code had to be tweeked for Python3 as the documentaion is also build on Python2.

```python
from manpy.simulation.imports import Source, Queue, Machine, Exit
from manpy.simulation.Globals import runSimulation

#define the objects of the model
S=Source('S1','Source',interArrivalTime={'Fixed':{'mean':0.5}},
entity='manpy.Part')
Q=Queue('Q1','Queue', capacity=1)
M=Machine('M1','Machine', processingTime={'Fixed':{'mean':0.25}})
E=Exit('E1','Exit')
#define predecessors and successors for the objects
S.defineRouting(successorList=[Q])
Q.defineRouting(predecessorList=[S],successorList=[M])
M.defineRouting(predecessorList=[Q],successorList=[E])
E.defineRouting(predecessorList=[M])
test=0
# add all the objects in a list
objectList=[S,Q,M,E]
# set the length of the experiment
maxSimTime=1440.0
# call the runSimulation giving the objects and the length of the experiment
runSimulation(objectList, maxSimTime)
# calculate metrics
working_ratio = (M.totalWorkingTime/maxSimTime)*100
# return results for the test

#print the results
print("the system produced", E.numOfExits, "parts")
print("the total working ratio of the Machine is", working_ratio, "%")

```
It was also noticed that the scripts had problem importing functions and were giving out error.

```python
Error: Module not Found
```
Given the difficulties in DREAM, it is better to move to the existing ManPy and test for functioning of its modules and compatibility with digital twin codes. If that also fails, it would be better to move SimPy, given that the codes might have to be reworked.
