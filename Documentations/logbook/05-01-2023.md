- Tried to install the library ManPy from the github, but for that they recommend to use `python setup.py install`. But this approach was not working. I also tried to create the library using `python setup.py sdist`, but it was also not working. It was showing the following error:

```python
py -> dream-0.0.1\.\dream\KnowledgeExtraction\KEtoolSimul8_examples\ParallelStationsFailures
error: could not create 'dream-0.0.1\.\dream\KnowledgeExtraction\KEtoolSimul8_examples\ParallelStationsFailu
res\ParallelStationsFailures.py': No such file or directory
```

We tried several ways to fix that and to avoid the error, but nothing worked.

- After that we took the the folder ```ManPy``` from the Digitial Twin folder and placed in an different folder. We tried to import some function from ManPy, some errors appeared because we were missing some libraries as follow
- SimPy3
- xlrd
- xlwt
- With this new folder ManPy and with the libraries it was possible to import function inside of that. But when trying to replicate the first example from the documentations it didn`t work, showing the following error

```python
File "C:\Users\pedro\.virtualenvs\dtenv-wkibMAem\lib\site-packages\zope\dottedname\resolve.py", line 44, in resolve
found = getattr(found, n)
AttributeError: module 'dream' has no attribute 'Part'
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dream.Part'
```
The testing code was

```python
import numpy
from manpy.simulation.imports import Source, Queue, Machine, Exit 

numpy.seterr(all="raise")
import simpy
from manpy.simulation.Globals import G
from manpy.simulation.Order import Order
import manpy.simulation.PrintRoute as PrintRoute
import manpy.simulation.ExcelHandler as ExcelHandler
from manpy.simulation.ProcessingTimeList import ProcessingTimeList
from manpy.simulation.RandomNumberGenerator import RandomNumberGenerator
import time
from random import Random
import manpy.simulation.Globals as Globals



S= Source('S1','Source',interArrivalTime={'Fixed':{'mean':0.5}}, entity='Dream.Part')
Q=Queue('Q1','Queue', capacity=1)
M=Machine('M1','Machine', processingTime={'Fixed':{'mean':0.25}})
E=Exit('E1','Exit') 
#define predecessors and successors for the objects 
S.defineRouting(successorList=[Q])
Q.defineRouting(predecessorList=[S],successorList=[M])
M.defineRouting(predecessorList=[Q],successorList=[E])
E.defineRouting(predecessorList=[M])
```

we can see the error because here we use the name Dream ```S= Source('S1','Source',interArrivalTime={'Fixed':{'mean':0.5}}, entity='Dream.Part')```.
Changing the name to "manpy" it worked.

### Next Steps
- Try to follow the documentation to understand better how ManPy works and see until when it's possible to replicate the examples even without using the right version of the ManPy (because we're using one from the Digital Twin and not the "Dream" one)
- Try to run the examples and replicate differents 
- Start testing the functions of the Digital Twin in case isoleted
- Test the SED with Simpy, maybe we can use directly this library instead of ManPy
