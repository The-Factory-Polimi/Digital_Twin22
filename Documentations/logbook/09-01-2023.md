  An initial understanding of the SimPy functions were carried out using the [initial steps](Documentations/simpy_tests.md). Following code was used to understand some primary functions:
  
  ```python
  import simpy

y1 = 2 # processing time

def machining_process1(env):
    print(f'Process1 starting at time {env.now}')
    yield env.timeout(y1)
    print(f'1_Processed for {y1}')
    yield env.timeout(y1+y1) # twice the processing time
    print(f'Process 1 end at {env.now}')

def machining_process2(env):
    print(f'Process2 starting at time {env.now}')
    yield env.timeout(y1)
    print(f'2_Processed for {y1}')
    yield env.timeout(y1)
    print(f'Process 2 end at {env.now}')

env = simpy.Environment()
env.process(machining_process1(env))
print(f'End of Manf. 1')
env.process(machining_process2(env))
print(f'End of Manf. 2')
env.run()
  ```
  
  It has to be noted that the function calls of the two machining processes was done parallely instead of second one waiting for the first one. This can be seen in the output:
  
  ```
End of Manf. 1
End of Manf. 2
Process1 starting at time 0
Process2 starting at time 0
1_Processed for 2
2_Processed for 2
Process 2 end at 4
Process 1 end at 6
  ```
  To run processes in series on a machine, ```resource = simpy.Resource(env, capacity=1)``` and ```resource.request()``` can be used which acquires the resource till the end of the process time ```env.timeout()``` after which the resource is released automatically.
  ### Difference between 'Resource' and 'Container'
  - Resource represents a resource that can be used by multiple processes concurrently, with each process using a certain number of resource units. For example, a printer with a capacity of 10 pages per minute could be modeled as a Resource with a capacity of 10.

  - Container represents a resource that can be used by a single process at a time. The process can take a certain amount of the resource from the container, and when it is finished using it, it can return the remainder back to the container. For example, a tank of water with a capacity of 100 liters could be modeled as a Container.
  
  ### 2s model of a closed loop system with buffers with single part type
  
  To model a closed-loop system with two machines and buffers in SimPy, you can define a process for each machine and a process for each buffer. You can also define a process to represent the flow of parts between the machines, buffers, and other parts of the system.

Here is an example of how you can model a closed-loop system with two machines and buffers in SimPy:
  
  ```python
  import simpy

# Define a Process class for the machines
class Machine(simpy.Process):
    def __init__(self, env, name, processing_time):
        super().__init__(env)
        self.name = name
        self.processing_time = processing_time
        
    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Wait for a part to be available
            part = yield env.process(input_buffer.get())
            
            # Process the part
            print(f"{self.name} is processing part {part}")
            yield env.timeout(self.processing_time)
            
            # Send the processed part to the output buffer
            yield env.process(output_buffer.put(part))
            
# Define a Process class for the buffers
class Buffer(simpy.Process):
    def __init__(self, env, capacity):
        super().__init__(env)
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.buffer = simpy.Store(env, capacity=capacity)
        
    def put(self, part):
        yield self.buffer.put(part)
        
    def get(self):
        return self.buffer.get()
        
# Create an environment and the input and output buffers
env = simpy.Environment()
input_buffer = Buffer(env, capacity=10)
output_buffer = Buffer(env, capacity=10)

# Create the machines
machine1 = Machine(env, "Machine 1", processing_time=5)
machine2 = Machine(env, "Machine 2", processing_time=10)

# Start the processes
env.process(input_buffer.put("Part 1"))
env.process(machine1)
env.process(machine2)

# Run the simulation
env.run()
```
  
In this example, the Machine class represents a machine in the system. It has a name, a processing_time attribute, and a run method that simulates the processing of a part. The Buffer class represents a buffer in the system. It has a capacity attribute and a buffer attribute, which is a Store instance from SimPy that is used to hold the parts in the buffer. The Buffer class also has put and get methods that can be used to add and remove parts from the buffer.

To start the simulation, you can create an instance of the Environment class, create the input and output buffers, and create the machines. Then, you can start the processes for the input buffer, the machines, and the output buffer by calling the env.process function. Finally, you can run the simulation by calling the env.run method.

This is just one example of how you can model a closed-loop system with two machines and buffers in SimPy. You can modify and extend this example to suit your specific needs. For more information and examples, you can refer to the SimPy documentation: https://simpy.read
