## Initial Setup
- The power suplly for 3 ESPs was not working - changing the power supply

- The MQTT channel was overloaded by many massages - Stop sending multiples messages for each reading, increase the process time

- Dont re-use old part ids , always takes the new one or send 0

month.day.hour.minute

obs:
- Digital a little bit behind than the physical because it waited for a while until it get a net started trace after the end time
- Changing the sensor from color detection to reflect (infrared) showed a good improvement

obs:
- Testing 2 synchronization consecutives

- BUG: start pointer always adding one even when it was not the same id as the previous end pointer.
- Validation with 1.0 and 1.0
