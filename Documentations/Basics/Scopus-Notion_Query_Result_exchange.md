2. Query results are downloaded as .csv file.
3. Do the following steps inside the csv file to match the headers in the Notion database:
    1. Rename **Title** column as **Name.**
    2. Add a new column between 1st and 2nd column named **Type**.
    3. Enter type as **Academic**. Use **shift+<double tap at corner of the cell>**  to copy the value till the end of the table. (Alternate way to fill by drag).
    4. Rename Document Type as **Material Type**.
    5. Find and replace "**;**" with "**,**". This is for Notion to recognize tags.
    6. Create a new column **Keyword**.
    7. Merge **Author Keyword** and **Index keyword** columns to **Keyword** column using **=concat(<cell1>,",",<cell2>")**. Copy the formula till the end of the column. **Copy** and **Paste: Values** in the same column to remove the concat() formula dependency to **Index keyword** and **Author keyword** column. This allows to delete the two columns without formula error.
    8. Rename **Affiliation** column as **Country**.
    9. Delete the unnecessary remaining columns like **Source**, **Index keyword** and **Author keyword**.
    10. Donâ€™t forget to click Save.
